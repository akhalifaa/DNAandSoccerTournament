# DNAandSoccerTournament

# Overview:
This repository contains two separate cool tasks I did with Python that have interesting applications:
1) Tournament.py is a script that simulates the famous soccer FIFA World Cup to come up the percent chance of a participating country to win based on past World Cup stats and winning streaks that give each country a rating. Along with it are the [2018m](https://github.com/akhalifaa/DNAandSoccerTournament/blob/main/2018m.csv) and [2019w](https://github.com/akhalifaa/DNAandSoccerTournament/blob/main/2019w.csv) that have the men's and women's soccer World Cup team ratings respectively.
2) DNA.py is a script that reads [DNA sequences](https://github.com/akhalifaa/DNAandSoccerTournament/tree/main/sequences) and searches a [DNA database](https://github.com/akhalifaa/DNAandSoccerTournament/tree/main/databases) to match that sequence to an individual. This concept has applications in crime detection and is actually used to investigate crimes.
